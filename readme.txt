My first attempt at redesigning a website (original as of 17/12/17 -  http://www.3di-info.com/). I felt that the original was too cluttered, and that this made the website more difficult to use.

Have tried to use colour/font to guide the user's eye through the page. Is the first time I've experimented with these ideas.

TO DO:

Test the page at other resolutions (my screen is roughly 1500x800)
Add responsive elements (buttons, etc.)
Refactor code (it's an awful mess)
